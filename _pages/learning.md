Hi, I'm Mike Moreno. I have over a decade of experience in audio programming using Pure Data, and have spent the past four years teaching others how to improve their skills and complete their audio projects successfully.

I offer one-to-one online lessons and consultations on audio programming, sound synthesis, and music technology.

I cover a range of topics, including but not limited to:
1. **Sound Synthesis:** Subtractive, Additive, F.M., Physical Modeling, Granular, Wavetable.
2. **Audio Effects:** Modulation FX, Filters, Waveshapers, Time-Based FX.
3. **Sound Design:** Analysis, Instrument design, Layering.
4. **Audio plug-in development:** Camomile and Plug Data.
5. **Mobile audio application prototyping:** MobMuPlat, Touch OSC and Pd party.
4. **Music composition:** Algorithmic, Generative, Reactive Visuals.


## Software

I use Pure Data as my primary tool for teaching these concepts because it is free. However, I am also open to using other software such as Max MSP, Faust, Pro Tools, Reaper, iZotope RX, Vital, etc.

## Duration and features

Each session lasts approximately **1 hour and 30 minutes**, and includes:
- Availability to ask questions and receive feedback via chat or email
- Access to the code, patches and material made during the session
- Session recording uploaded to YouTube as an unlisted video
- Optional private GitHub repository for storage
