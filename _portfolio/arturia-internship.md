During my studies in 2016 I had the opportunity to do an online internship with Arturia which consisted of beta testing the V Collection 5 and developing a drum sampler prototype for the BeatStep Pro.

## V Collection 5

I was part of the Beta Test for the Arturia V Collection 5 for several plugins. My credit is in the special thanks section.
