**MetaPortals** is a set of NFTs made by [ST!VN Studios](https://www.artbysteven.com/).
I was hired to do sound design for these short videos.
It proved to be quite a creative exercise, since all the sound effects (except for the background ambience) were made using only Pure Data.
My process would be the following.
1. First, I received a script with some key visuals, annotations and concepts before the actual video.
2. Then I would start capturing and collecting background ambience sounds based on the filming location.
3. Once I received the final video, I analyzed and marked important actions on my DAW's timeline.
4. One thing that made the sound design and sync a lot easier was using Camomile (Pure Data as an audio-plugin) for creating triggers and automatizations in the synthesized sounds. That way, I could shape and render the sound in real-time without having to switch back and forth between programs.

Finally, I ended up with quite a library of procedural generated sounds like: electricity, whooshes, drones, water-like sounds, etc.
