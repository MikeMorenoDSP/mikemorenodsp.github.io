MexSynthCo 2019 was Mexico’s first synthesizer convention lasting from January 31 to February 3. The event was hosted by the Hola Wave Store and had interesting presentations from people working in the synthesizer and music technology industry. Some notable speakers where Nick Valente from Moog and Mark Verbos from Verbos Electronics. I had the opportunity to give a speech about my work making plugins using Pure Data and Camomile.

Overall an excellent and enjoyable experience.
I can’t wait for participating in the next MexSynthCo 2020!
